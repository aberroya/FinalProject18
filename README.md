Game Description 
   
   This is a battle royale-style fighting game with three opponent classes: Paladin, Berserker, and Wizard. The player will keep cycling through the opponents until the Player's health points drop to 0. As the Player progresses through the game, the Player will receive item drops from each Fighter they survive. Item drops, depending on the class of the item, can give the Player boosts in health points, defense, and attack. The player's defense value is subtracted from the opponent's attack points, and the resulting value is subtracted from the Player's health points.
